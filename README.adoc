* The AddressbookApp is basically an enhanced version of the Addressbook-level4 which is build keeping in mind the importance of the remark function. 
* The AddressbookApp is a  GUI(Graphical User Interface) but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is *written in OOP fashion*. It provides a *reasonably well-written* code example that is *significantly bigger* (around 6 KLoC)than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules.
